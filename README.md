# Survey Service
Survey management and evaluation service

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed on your machine. You will also need to have a [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) account setup with the desired [sender authentication](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth).

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Run

```
mvn clean package
```

This will create the executable JAR file in the `target` directory, which can be used for executing the server application. Copy this JAR file to the desired location.

In order to use customized configuration, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config).
You can place a file named `application.properties` right next to this JAR file.

## Configuration

Next to the common [server properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/appendix-application-properties.html#server-properties)and [logging properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/appendix-application-properties.html#core-properties), which can be placed on the customized configuration, the application uses the following configuration properties.
